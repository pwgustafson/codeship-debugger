# Codeship Debugger aka Wide Hull or Bilge Pump or Poop Deck (working titles)*
**TL:DR** - A chrome extension that will expand the codeship build output to help with debugging.

### What exactly does it do?
It's pretty simple, when viewing the build details for a deploy - the **Test Commands** pane will be expanded to full width of the screen and remove the widget content on the right side of the screen - allowing for a more detailed view of the commands - which is especially helpful during any failures.

### How to install
